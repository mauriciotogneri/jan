**Jan** is a purely functional programming language. It is named after **Jan ≈Åukasiewicz**, a Polish logician and philosopher creator of the **Polish notation**, also known as **Prefix notation**, which is a form of notation for logic, arithmetic, and algebra. The distinguishing feature of this notation is that it places operators to the left of their operands. Given that the arity of the operators is fixed, the result is a syntax lacking parentheses or other brackets that can still be parsed without ambiguity.
